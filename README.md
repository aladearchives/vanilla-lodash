Implementation of Lodash Library Functions, using Vanilla Javascript
## Codecademy Project
As part of the codecademy Javascript Course, we recreated the Lodash Library using Ecmascript functions, on a single object.
## Testing
The Testing folder should be run on Node and there is a test for every method in the main object module. 

To run a file using node, we type the ```node``` command in a command line followed by the name of the file. For example, to run the main file we are working on, we would run ```node _.js```.

Our test files are all located in the test/ directory. To run the test suite for this task, type ```node test/lodash.js``` in your terminal and then press enter. The test will either throw errors if something is not currently working properly in your code or will print a success message to the console if your code is good to go.
